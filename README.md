# School-Grade-Project
This repository contains a Python script that converts student scores into grades based on predefined criteria. It's designed as a straightforward, efficient tool for educators, students, and programmers to utilize and learn from.

## Project Overview
The `main.py` script offers a simple yet effective way to categorize student performance into distinct grades. Given a set of scores, it assigns each student a grade of "Outstanding," "Exceeds Expectations," "Acceptable," or "Fail," according to their achievement.

## Features
- **Simple Input:** Utilizes a dictionary to input student names and their corresponding scores.
- **Automatic Grading:** Converts numerical scores into descriptive grades based on set thresholds.
- **Easy to Customize:** Thresholds and grading criteria can be easily adjusted to fit different scoring systems.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/School-Grade-Project.git
    ```
   
2. **Run the Script:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Navigate to the cloned directory, then to the `main.py` file within the `School-Grade-Project` folder, and run:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Modify the `student_scores` Dictionary:**
   - Open `main.py` located in the `School-Grade-Project` folder.
   - Edit the file to include the names and scores of your students for grading.

4. **View the Output:**
   - The script prints a dictionary with student names as keys and their grades as values.

## Customization
To adjust the grading criteria, modify the conditional statements within the loop in `main.py` to match your desired thresholds.
